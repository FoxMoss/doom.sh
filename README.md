# Doom.sh

Doom running entirely in pure bash.

## Acompanying Repos
[terminaldoom](https://github.com/FoxMoss/terminaldoom) is a copy of the doom source with changes to match the RISCV equivelent.
[rv32emu-doom](https://github.com/FoxMoss/rv32emu-doom) is the reference implentation I used to verify accuracy of the bash implentation.

## Credit
Hudge credit to velzie for starting the bash riscv emulator! And chlonr for making the reference implentation that the bash emulator was based on, aswell as starting embeded doom which this project uses a modifyed copy.
